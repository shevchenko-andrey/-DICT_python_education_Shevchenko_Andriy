Mycoprotein produced in cell culture has environmental benefits over beef


                    Would environmental damage be reduced by replacing beef with mycoprotein produced in cell culture? Modelling shows that this change could greatly cut global deforestation, pasture area and greenhouse-gas emissions.

The development of alternatives to animal-sourced foods has increased during the past few decades as a response to the negative environmental impacts of livestock production. These alternatives include foods that are produced by the industrial-scale culture of animal, plant and microbial cells. Studies have shown that, per unit of mass, cell-cultured foods can have a lower environmental footprint than that of proteins from livestock1, but comparisons of global-level assessments have been lacking. Writing in Nature, Humpenöder et al.2 report the first global analysis of the environmental benefits that could be achieved by substituting beef with mycoprotein from cell culture.
