This week, a team show that replacing 20% of future meat consumption with protein derived from microbes could reduce associated emissions and halve deforestation rates.Research article: Humpenöder et alNews and Views: Mycoprotein produced in cell culture has environmental benefits over beef08:21 Research HighlightsHow saltwater crocodiles’ penchant for pigs is driving population recovery in Australia, and solving the mystery of some eighteenth-century porcelain’s iridescent lustre.Research Highlight: Pork dinners fuel huge crocodiles’ return from near-extinctionResearch Highlight: The nanoparticles that give a famed antique porcelain its dazzle10:47 The neurons that help mosquitoes distinguish smellFemale Aedes aegypti mosquitoes strongly prefer human odours to those of animals, but how they distinguish between them is not well understood.
