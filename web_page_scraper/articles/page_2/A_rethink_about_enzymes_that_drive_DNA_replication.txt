A rethink about enzymes that drive DNA replication


                    It has long been thought that two enzymes, the kinases CDC7 and CDK2, are both needed to trigger DNA replication in mammalian cells. This view is challenged by evidence that offers a revised view of which kinases are essential.

If you read the scientific literature about DNA replication, you will find that two complexes, each containing an enzyme called a kinase and a regulatory protein, are involved in the initiation of this process. Writing in Nature, Suski et al.1 provide evidence of the need for a re-evaluation of the kinases involved.

Updates & Corrections

Correction 05 May 2022: The original version of this News & Views incorrectly said that the enzymes CDK1 and CDC7 phosphorylate certain lysine amino-acid residues in subunits of the MCM2-7 helicase enzyme. This has been corrected.
