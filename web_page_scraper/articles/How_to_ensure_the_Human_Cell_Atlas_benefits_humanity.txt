The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is a global consortium of scientists who are compiling an exhaustive guidebook on the types and properties of all human cells (see https://osf.io/sk697). This includes best-practice recommendations for making HCA research results beneficial for everyone. The consortium strongly opposes exploitation of differences in those results for any form of discrimination or racial profiling.
